# Dream AI Teacher

An interactive AI-powered learning experience.

## Quick Start
1. Open in an AI-powered IDE (Cursor or Windsurf recommended).
   - Start a chat with: **"I want to learn AI, where should I start?"**
2. Or simply copy any of the prompts from the `.md` files into a thinking-capable, larger model (e.g. Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and learn directly.

## Recommended
- Best experience: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-5 Thinking, others.
- Works in both IDE chat and standalone paste-and-learn mode
