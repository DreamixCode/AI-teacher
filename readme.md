# Dream AI Teacher
An interactive AI-powered tutor.

## Quick Start
# Option A - General purpose AI chat (ChatGPT, Synechron Nexus chat, MS Teams Copilot...)
Just copy-paste the content of some of the example starter prompts in the "general_chat_starter_prompts" folder to 
your AI chat of choice (ChatGPT, Synechron Nexus chat, MS Teams Copilot...). And start learning by interacting with the chatbot.

# Option B - AI poewered IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code with Copilot or Cline)
1. Open in AI-powered IDE (Cursor or Windsurf or VS Code with Copilot).
2. Use the Agent mode. Recommended model to use is Claude 3.7 Sonnet or similar
3. Start chat with some of the starter prompts below.
   "Lead me through the AI course described in the file ai-course-dev-curriculum.md"
   "What is the next lesson in the curriculum?"
   "Ask me some questions about my last learning session for rehearsal."
   "Am I doing well in the course? Give me some feedback, especially regarding my homework project."
4. Enjoy learning at your own pace through interactive AI guidance, and seamlessly improving your prompting skills ;).

# For both options:
If there are any issues with your experience with the AI teacher, please report the issue in this repo:

## Alternative approach if you don't have access to an AI-powered IDE
1. copy paste the AI-teacher-instructions.md to the AI chat of your choice (as a system message if possible).
2. Add the curiculum file as an additional context (ai-course-dev-curriculum.md)
3. Continue point 3 from the previous section - same as the AI-powered IDE approach.
