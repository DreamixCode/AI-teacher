# Vector Databases for RAG ‚Äì Learning Plan

## Teaching Guidelines (apply to every bullet point)

For each topic/bullet, the AI teacher must:

1. **Explain the concept**
   - Use simple, precise language.
   - Relate it to real-world data science or RAG applications.

2. **Show Python code examples**
   - Use libraries like `faiss`, `weaviate-client`, `qdrant-client`, `chromadb`, or mock examples if needed.
   - Keep code minimal but realistic.

3. **Explain what the code does**
   - Walk through step by step.
   - Highlight the ‚ÄúPythonic way‚Äù and best practices.

4. **Give practical notes**
   - Why it matters for RAG.
   - Pitfalls, performance considerations, and alternatives.

5. **End with a short summary + optional ‚ÄúTry it yourself‚Äù challenge**
   - Example: *‚ÄúTry inserting 5 custom text chunks into FAISS and perform a cosine similarity search.‚Äù*

## 1. Fundamentals of Vector Databases

### What Are Vector Databases?
- Embeddings as vector representations of data.
- Why SQL is insufficient for similarity search.
- Role of vector databases in AI and RAG systems.

### Core Concepts
- Vectors and embeddings.
- Distance metrics: cosine similarity, Euclidean, dot product.
- Recall vs latency vs memory trade-offs.

### Index Structures
- Flat index (brute force).
- Inverted file (IVF).
- Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW).
- Product Quantization (PQ).

### Popular Vector Databases
- Open-source: FAISS, Milvus, Weaviate, Qdrant.
- Managed: Pinecone, Chroma Cloud, Redis Vector, Vespa.
- Pros/cons and typical use cases.

## 2. Vector DB Operations

### CRUD Operations
- Inserting vectors + metadata.
- Updating and deleting.
- Handling versioned data.

### Indexing & Search
- Building and updating indexes.
- Performing similarity search (k-NN).
- Filtering with metadata (hybrid search).
- Batch vs streaming ingestion.

### Evaluation & Monitoring
- Measuring recall, latency, throughput.
- Benchmarking different index types.
- Monitoring for drift and stale data.

## 3. Vector DBs in the Context of RAG

### Role in RAG Pipeline
- User query ‚Üí embedding ‚Üí DB search ‚Üí context retrieval ‚Üí LLM generation.
- Separation of concerns: embedding model vs DB vs LLM.

### Retrieval Strategies
- Top-k retrieval.
- Max marginal relevance (MMR).
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword).
- Cross-encoder reranking.

### Data Engineering for RAG
- Chunking strategies for documents.
- Metadata schemas for filtering.
- Deduplication and version control of embeddings.
- Refreshing and reindexing pipelines.

### Scaling RAG
- Sharding, replication, and distributed setups.
- Dealing with millions/billions of embeddings.
- Latency optimization in production.

## 4. Advanced Topics

### Security & Governance
- Access control and multi-tenancy.
- Data privacy considerations (GDPR/HIPAA in RAG).

### Integration with Ecosystem
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy connectors.
- Using vector DBs in cloud-native architectures.
- Combining structured (SQL) + unstructured (vector) queries.

### Future Directions
- Vector + graph DB convergence.
- Native multimodal support (text + image + audio embeddings).
- Agents that interact with multiple vector stores.

## Kickoff Instruction
üëâ Begin teaching immediately with **Section 1 (and the title of the section)**.
Talk about the whole Section.

After finishing that, ask:
*‚ÄúWould you like me to continue to **Section 2 (and the title of the section)?‚Äù***

Talk about the whole Section. Continue with all the next sections.

If you receive a question, finish your answer with a proposition to continue to the next section.
