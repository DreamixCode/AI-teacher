# Advanced Python Data Structures & Pydantic ‚Äì Learning Plan

## Teaching Guidelines (apply to every bullet point)

For each topic/bullet, the AI teacher must:

1. **Explain the concept**
   - Use precise but clear language.
   - Relate it to real-world backend, data engineering, or ML pipelines.

2. **Show Python code examples**
   - Minimal, idiomatic, production-oriented.
   - Compare built-ins vs libraries (e.g., `dataclasses` vs `pydantic`).

3. **Explain what the code does**
   - Step-by-step walkthrough.
   - Highlight best practices and pitfalls.

4. **Give practical notes**
   - Performance considerations, type safety, immutability, maintainability.
   - Where to use (or avoid) each structure.

5. **End with a short summary + optional ‚ÄúTry it yourself‚Äù challenge**
   - Example: *‚ÄúTry creating a frozen dataclass that validates input types and compare it with a Pydantic model.‚Äù*

## 1. Comparing Python‚Äôs Data Structures for Modeling

### NamedTuples
- Lightweight immutable structures.
- Pros/cons vs `dict` or `dataclass`.
- Typing support (`typing.NamedTuple`).

### Dataclasses
- Auto-generated `__init__`, `__repr__`, comparison methods.
- Mutability vs `frozen=True`.
- Default values, `field(init=False)`, post-init hooks.

### Pydantic (teaser)
- Runtime validation.
- Strong typing beyond static hints.
- Integrations in FastAPI, ML pipelines, configs.

### Practical Comparisons
- Performance benchmarks.
- When to prefer each: lightweight config, validation-heavy schemas, immutable records.

## 2. Pydantic Deep Dive

### Core Features
- `BaseModel` usage.
- Type validation + coercion (int‚Üístr, str‚ÜíUUID, etc.).
- Custom validators (`@validator`, `@field_validator`).

### Advanced Features
- `Config` options (`frozen`, `orm_mode`, `extra`, etc.).
- Nested models.
- Generic models.
- Computed fields.
- Validation errors and error handling.

### Pydantic v1 vs v2
- Performance improvements.
- Differences in validators and settings.
- Migration considerations.

### Pydantic in Practice
- FastAPI request/response models.
- ML pipeline configs.
- Data ingestion with validation.

## 3. Other Structured & Immutable Data Practices

### Sets, FrozenSets
- Uniqueness, membership tests.
- When immutability matters (`frozenset`).

### Dicts and Alternatives
- Standard `dict` vs `collections.OrderedDict`.
- Immutability with `types.MappingProxyType`.
- (Optional) frozen-dict libraries for safety in configs.

### Typed & Safer Collections
- `typing.TypedDict`.
- `collections.ChainMap`, `defaultdict`, `Counter`.

### Practical Notes
- Performance tradeoffs.
- Pitfalls: mutable defaults, hashability issues.
- Real-world patterns in configs, caching, pipelines.

---

## 4. Beyond the Basics ‚Äì Patterns and Best Practices

### Serialization & Interoperability
- `dataclasses.asdict`, `pydantic.json()`.
- Converting between dataclasses ‚Üî Pydantic models ‚Üî dicts.
- Serialization formats: JSON, YAML, msgpack.

### Immutability & Safety
- Why immutability matters in concurrent code.
- Defensive copies (`copy.deepcopy`, `dataclasses.replace`).
- Practical use in microservices and ML jobs.

---

## 5. Modern Typing & Schema Design

### Type Hints in Depth
- `Literal`, `Union`/`|`, `Annotated`.
- Type narrowing with `match`.
- Protocols & structural subtyping.

### Schema Evolution
- Versioning of models.
- Deprecating fields gracefully.
- Handling backward compatibility.

## Kickoff Instruction
üëâ Begin teaching immediately with **Section 1 (and the title of the section)**.
Talk about the whole Section.

After finishing that, ask:
*‚ÄúWould you like me to continue to **Section 2 (Pydantic Deep Dive)**?‚Äù*

If the student asks a question mid-topic, finish the answer and offer to resume the next section.
